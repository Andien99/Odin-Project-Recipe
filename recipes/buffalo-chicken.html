    <!-- List of ingredients -->
    <h4> Steps </h4>
    <ol>   
        <li>Whisk together all of the Buffalo Marinade ingredients in a medium bowl. Measure out ¼ cup and add to a shallow dish or freezer bag, along with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add chicken and toss evenly to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator 2 hours up to overnight.</li>
        <li>To the remaining marinade, make your Buffalo Glaze by whisking in 1 tablespoon honey and 1 ½ teaspoons lime juice. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.</li>
        <li>STOVETOP DIRECTIONS</li>
        <li>Let chicken sit at room temperature for 15-30 minutes (time permitting).</li>
        <li>Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. Once very hot, add chicken and cook, undisturbed for 3-5 minutes, or until nicely browned (or blackened if you prefer) on one side. Turn chicken over, cover, and reduce heat to medium. Cook for approximately 5-7 more minutes (depending on thickness of chicken), or until chicken is cooked through. Remove to a cutting board and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Brush chicken with desired amount of glaze – for more heat, more glaze; for less heat, less glaze.</li>
        <li>GRILLING DIRECTIONS</li>
        <li>Let chicken sit at room temperature for 15-30 minutes (time permitting).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, grease and preheat the grill to medium heat, 375-450°F.</li>
        <li>Grill chicken undisturbed for 5-7 minutes per side, or until chicken is cooked through. (An inserted thermometer should read 160 degrees F.)</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from grill and let rest 5 minutes before slicing. Brush chicken with desired amount of glaze – for more heat, more glaze; for less heat, less glaze.</li>
    </ol>
