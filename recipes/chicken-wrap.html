    <!-- Short Description of the food -->
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken thigh</li>
        <li>Protein wraps</li>

    <!-- List of ingredients -->
    <h4> Steps </h4>
    <ol>   
        <li>Season the chicken cutlets with smoked paprika, chili powder, garlic granules, salt, and pepper. Or, use your favorite seasoning.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan or grill pan, or preheat your outdoor grill.</li>
        <li>Place the seasoned chicken cutlets on the grill or pan, and cook on both sides until the chicken is cooked through. The internal temperature of the center of the chicken must be at least 165°F (74°C). A kitchen thermometer must be used to check.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the grill, and allow it to rest on a plate for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken up, and assemble the wrap.</li>
        <li>To assemble, layer lettuce leaves on tortilla bread, followed by the chicken, shredded cheese, and a drizzle of ranch dressing (extra ranch for me, please!).</li>
        <li>Seal the tortilla and place the wrap on the grill (or lightly oiled grill pan). Cook for a minute or 2 on both sides until it’s slightly warmed through but the grill marks are visible. Remove and slice the wraps in half, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
